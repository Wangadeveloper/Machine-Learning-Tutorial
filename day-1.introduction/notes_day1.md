# Day 1: Introduction to Machine Learning ðŸ¤–

## What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn from data without explicit programming.

**Example:** Instead of coding rules to detect cats, we feed images of cats/non-cats, and the model *learns* the distinguishing features.

## AI, ML, and Deep Learning
- **AI**: Broad field â†’ machines that mimic intelligence  
- **ML**: Subset of AI â†’ learns from data  
- **DL**: Subset of ML â†’ neural networks with multiple layers  

---

## Why ML is Important
- Automation  
- Scalability  
- Pattern recognition  
- Personalization  

---

## Application Areas
- Finance â†’ Fraud detection, credit scoring  
- E-commerce â†’ Recommendation engines  
- Healthcare â†’ Disease diagnosis  
- Autonomous vehicles â†’ Self-driving cars

## Narrow AI vs AGI
- **Narrow AI** â†’ Focused, task-specific (e.g. spam filter, Siri)  
- **AGI** â†’ Hypothetical, human-like intelligence across tasks
